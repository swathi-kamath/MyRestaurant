Though the brewery is visible you won't get any smell so it is good for everyone including family outings. Not a great place for vegetarians."

Music too Loud. Unfortunately the beer though brewed fresh gets stale by the time it gets to the table because of the way the service is structured.Slightly on the expensive side. Didn't feel it's value for money. A poor experience all in all."

This is definitely a minus probable solution is that they can give smaller samplers Otherwise it's an best place in North Bangalore to go out !!!"
